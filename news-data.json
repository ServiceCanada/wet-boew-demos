Since we began operations in 2008, our mission has been to help Canadians who are having service issues with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). We do this by examining complaints and by increasing awareness of their rights, namely under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Although the OTO is very small compared to the CRA, we have accomplished an impressive scale of work for our size. ",
